## Deployment ##

** Add instructions about how to deploy to Heroku
How to deploy code in Heroku:
    1) Install git and the heroku cli
    2) Create a herokue remote
    3) The heroku create CLI command creates a new empty application on Heroku, along with an associated empty Git re pository. 
    4) Deploy code. To deploy your app to Heroku, use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s main branch to your heroku remote. For example:


## CI/CD ##

CI/CD process: 
    File called workflows.yml which is a shell script,runs all our tasks. We can do the testing by running rails rspec.
    Everytime we would push code to github repository, it automatically deploy to heroku before heroku was hacked.
