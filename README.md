# README

The testing for this project was done manually because testing is not possible locally since we use python to edit the sql database that ruby on rails uses.
As a result our Unit testing, and Integration Testing files are commented out, and we do our testing in python. Simple Cov currently shows 100 percent due to those changes.	

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
